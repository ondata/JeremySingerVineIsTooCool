## Jeremy Singer-Vine is too cool

[Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://twitter.com/jsvine) is too cool, especially because of his great **[Data Is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural)** newsletter.

For this reason we ([@dontyna](https://twitter.com/dontyna) & [@aborruso](https://twitter.com/aborruso)) have built with :heart_eyes: a **[web page search](https://ondata.github.io/JeremySingerVineIsTooCool/)**, a **[RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dataisplural)** and a **[bookmarklet](https://ondata.github.io/JeremySingerVineIsTooCool/bookmarklet.html)** to look inside it and stay up to date.
